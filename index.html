                            Currently, I work as the Head of Technical Knowledge for an on-site corporate IT support help desk at Intercontinental Hotels Group (IHG). I started as a regular technician after graduating from a technical college and was given no training for the position.

                        I look to push myself everyday to learn more and master my skills. Following the completion of the Web Developer course I used my knowledge to learn Windows PowerShell scripting and created a text based menu system to assist in automating my group’s everyday work. I am seeking other opportunities that will continue to push me to build and learn more everyday.
